Website for Abbott Artistry

This was my very first web development project I completed: a website for my wife's macrame business, Abbott Artistry. 
I initially created it using just HTML and CSS, but added more functionality and other things such as smooth scrolling with JavaScript.
Before starting the project, I created a wireframe to use as a guide throughout development. 

Using frameworks and libraries such as bootstrap,
materialize.css, animate.css and the AOS JavaScript library, I was able to complete the project and then host it through GoDaddy. The whole
project was an amazing learning opportunity for me, and every step of the way I was able to teach myself more. The code is far from perfect,
but I hope you can check out the site and let me know what you think!
